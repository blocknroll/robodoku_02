cell has 9 possible values
if can reduce values down to one, that is the answer for that cell
read-in puzzle from file
create a collection of cells 9-wide x 9-tall
find cells we dont have a set value for (80 set values, 1 unset val)
use the known values to reduce the possibilites in the unknown values
  (through a couple of different algorithms)
until we get to 1 possibility - set that value for the cell
use that info to reduce possibilities in any other unknown cells
  as the algorithm evolves...

1. build a cell
2 situations for cell value:
either the value is dictated
or, the cell should be able to figure out its own by a deduction process

!!value - way to set a truthy to true, or falsy to false
    nil or false will become false
    everything else will become true
